# Airbnb Pricing Analytics
This project aims to develop a predictive model for vacation rental prices on Airbnb rentals in Sydney 
to provide market advice to hosts, real estate investors, and other stakeholders.

## General Information
Airbnb (www.airbnb.com) is a global platform that runs an online marketplace for short term travel rentals.
To achieve this project’s goals, the dataset will contain detailed information on a number of existing Airbnb listings in Sydney.

## Dataset description
Each row corresponds to a separate Airbnb listing in Sydney. Because the dataset was scraped from Airbnb, 
a detailed description of the variables is not available. However, you can identify their meanings from the context.
The response variable, price, is the last column in the training dataset. It gives the price per night for each listing in Australian Dollars. The latitude and 
longitude variables specify the geographic location of each property. Some variables are binary, with the word “true” recorded as “t” and “false” recorded as “f”.
